		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p><em>Journal Citation Reports (JCR)</em> is a tool that keeps track of the numbers of citations to articles published in top-tier scholarly journals in the hard and social sciences. You can use the <b>impact factor</b> of a journal as an indicator of how important that journal is to people in a scholarly community.</p>
		<br />
	</div> <!-- off white box with introduction -->
	<div class="information">
		<h2>What is impact factor?</h2>
		<p><b>Impact factor</b> is a way of measuring the number of citations articles in a given academic journal receive on average. It is calculated by dividing the number of article citations by the total number of articles that could be cited from a particular journal. It is used as an indicator of the importance of a journal in a field, with journals with higher impact factors being more important.</p>
		<h2>Why am I having problems finding some journals using <em>JCR</em>?</h2>
		<p>Generally, <em>JCR</em> only indexes the top journals in a discipline, so this may mean that the journal in which you article is published has a lower profile in its discipline. It also can mean that the journal serves a niche expert audience, has a very specific subject matter, or serves a small subfield. In these cases, it may be best journal for your purposes, even though it is not one of the top journals in its discipline.</p>

		<h2>Other Indicators of Impact</h2>
		<p><b>Impact factor</b> is not the only indicator of impact provided by <em>JCR</em>. Each column in a journal entry represents a different way of evaluating impact. Because the value of information in a discipline differs according to how it is produced, disseminated, and used by members of a scholarly community, comparing the different indicators of several journals can help you better understand their relative importance.</p>
		<h2>What is journal rank?</h2>
		<p>The <b>rank</b> enables you to sort the list of journals in a field by <b>impact factor,</b> <b>immediacy index,</b> and other measures of impact, influence, and prestige. This makes comparing journals within a discipline or field easier.</p>
		<h2>What is eigenfactor?</h2>
		<p>Like <b>impact factor,</b> the <b>eigenfactor</b> score measures the number of citations to a journal; unlike <b>impact factor,</b> the <b>eigenfactor</b> weights citations from important journals more heavily than those from unimportant journals, providing an arguably better metric for evaluating a journal.</p>
		<h2>What is the immediacy index?</h2>
		<p>The <b>immediacy index</b> measures how frequently articles in a journal are cited in the year that they are published; this offers a proxy measure for how urgent the research published in a journal is to scholars. This is especially important in fields that make rapid advances with significant material impacts. For instance, <b>immediacy index</b> can be important in many medical and technology-related fields.</p>
		<h2>What is the article influencer score?</h2>
		<p>The <b>article influencer score</b> measures how influential articles published in a journal are over the course of the five years after publication. Scores above 1.0 are for journals with above average 5-year influence, while scores below 1.0 are for journals with below average 5-year influence.</p>

		<h2>Words of Caution</h2>
		<p>Citation metrics are imperfect. The best way to evaluate importance is through experience and familiarity with a field. Also be aware that citation behaviors differ substantially between subfields and may not be particularly important in some areas of study.</p>
		<p>Ultimately, when researching, the most important thing to figure out is whether articles make substantial contributions to the scholarly conversations relevant to your research question. </p>
