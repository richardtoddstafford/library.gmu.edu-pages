		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p><em>Journal Citation Reports (JCR)</em> is a tool that keeps track of the numbers of citations to articles published in top-tier scholarly journals in the hard and social sciences. You can use the <b>median impact factor</b> of all journals in a particular discipline reported in <em>JCR</em> as a baseline for comparing the impact factors of specific journals in that discipline.</p>
	</div> <!-- off white box with introduction -->
	<div class="information">
		<h2>What is impact factor?</h2>
		<p><b>Impact factor</b> is a way of measuring the number of citations articles in a given academic journal receive on average. It is calculated by dividing the number of article citations by the total number of articles that could be cited from a particular journal. It is used as an indicator of the importance of a journal in a field, with journals with higher impact factors being more important.</p>
		<h2>What is the median impact factor?</h2>
		<p>The <b>median impact factor</b> is a number that helps you understand the "middle" impact factor of indexed journals in a field. Half of the journals in a discipline or subfield will be above the median impact factor, while half of the journals will be below this figure. </p>
	<h2>Why find the median impact factor?</h2>
		<p>Especially when you are first familiarizing yourself with a field or discipline, you will not know whether or not the articles you are finding were published in reputable, high-impact journals. <em>JCR</em> enables you to make some quick determinations that will help you understand this scholarly context. While the measures of influence reported by <em>JCR</em> are no substitute for familiarity and experience with a field, they can help you begin to orient yourself in relation to the field.</p>

		<ol>
<li>
				<p><span class="firsentence">Locate <em>JCR</em> on the library website.</span> Simply search for "Journal Citation Reports" in the <em><b>Search Database Titles & Descriptions</b></em> field on the <em><b>Articles & more</b></em> tab.</p>
				<img alt=" " src="/sites/default/files/users/rstaffo2/JCR/00JCR.png" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><span class="firstsentence">Select the "Categories by Rank" tab.</span> This will list all of the indexed categories.</p>
				<img alt=" " src="/sites/default/files/users/rstaffo2/JCR/01JCR.png" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><span class="firstsentence">Click the "Select Categories" link and choose the disciplines or subfields that you are most interested in.</span> The median impact factors in highly specialized subfields and interdisciplinary areas of study often differ from those in the larger disciplines. In order to get a more complete view of the field, select a field as well as relevant subfields or interdisciplinary fields.</p>			
				<img alt=" " src="/sites/default/files/users/rstaffo2/JCR/02JCR.png" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><span class="firstsentence">Usually, you will leave the year set to the most current year.</span> You may use the other years to learn about the historical impact factor of a journal.</p>

			</li>

			<li>
				<p><span class="firstsentence">If you selected more than one category, Journal Citation Reports will rank them.</span> Since different subfields have differing citation practices, this ranking is not particularly useful when trying to understand the influence and importance of a particular periodical.</p>

			</li>
			<li>
				<p><span class="firstsentence">Write down the median impact factors in these fields</span> and compare them to the impact factors of the journals you are investigating.</p>					
				<img alt=" " src="/sites/default/files/users/rstaffo2/JCR/06JCR.png" />
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><span class="firstsentence">If the impact factor of a journal is lower than the median impact factor in the discipline, subfield, or interdisciplinary field it serves,</span> this may mean that it less important or influential than most of the other journals serving that scholarly community.</p>

		<h2>Words of Caution</h2>
		<p>Citation metrics are imperfect. The best way to evaluate importance is through experience and familiarity with a field. Also be aware that citation behaviors differ substantially between subfields and may not be particularly important in some areas of study.</p>
		<p>Ultimately, when researching, the most important thing to figure out is whether articles make substantial contributions to the scholarly conversations relevant to your research question. </p>
